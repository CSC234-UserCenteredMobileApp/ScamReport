# Sprint 2 — Foundations (2026-04-30 → 2026-05-06)

> **Goal:** ship the foundational infrastructure (RBAC, CI gates, biometric, Verdict + Feed canonical screens) so Sprint 3 can build features on a stable base.
>
> **Demo:** mid-sprint check; full Sprint 2 review at start of Sprint 3 (2026-05-07).
>
> **How to use this board:** find a row with `_unclaimed_` in the **Owner** column, edit the cell to your name (`A.P` / `T.P` / `S.P` / `Y.R` / `B.S`), open a PR following the template, tick the test gate, mark the row as `done` in **Status** when merged. **Tests must pass before opening the PR** (team rule, 2026-04-28). Integration tests across feature boundaries are S.P's responsibility — feature authors hand off after their unit/widget tests pass.
>
> **Branch protection:** `main` is protected. Land changes via PR with at least one review + all CI gates green.

## Task board

| # | Task | Layer | Owner | Depends on | Test gate | Status |

| S2-09 | `.github/workflows/security.yml` — gitleaks + bun audit + dart analyze | infra | A.P | none | green CI run | done (PR `infra/s2-quality-gates`) |
| S2-10 | Crashlytics expansion in `apps/mobile/lib/main.dart` (FlutterError.onError + zone error handler + dev force-crash button) | mobile | _unclaimed_ → recommend **B.S** | pubspec deps (already present) | manual: trigger crash, see in Crashlytics dashboard | pending |
| S2-11 | Integration test scaffold `apps/mobile/integration_test/login_smoke_test.dart` — cold start → login → home | mobile + integration | _claimed by S.P_ | S2-04 + S2-05 (or stubs) | `flutter test integration_test/` passes on emulator | pending |
| S2-12 | Provision `evidence` Storage bucket in Supabase dashboard + verify with `getSignedUrl` smoke test | infra | A.P | none (out-of-repo console click) | manual smoke from `apps/api/src/core/supabase/storage.ts` | done (bucket created 2026-04-28; smoke test outstanding) |
| S2-13 | Enable Firestore in Firebase console + `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` from infra PR's `firestore.rules` | infra | A.P | infra PR merged | rules visible in console; emulator test passes | done (deployed to `scamreport-62b4c` 2026-04-28) |

## Notes / decisions captured during the sprint

<!-- Append a one-liner here whenever the team makes a non-obvious call so
     the audit report can pull from a single timeline later. -->

- _2026-04-28_: A.P opens `infra/s2-prereqs` covering S2-01, S2-02, plus shared scaffolding (firestore.rules, firebase.json, CODEOWNERS, PR template, this board, pubspec deps, rollback plan stub). Other rows unblocked once that PR merges.
- _2026-04-28_: PRs #5 (infra prereqs), #6 (CODEOWNERS real handles) merged. Firestore enabled in `scamreport-62b4c`; rules deployed via `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`. Supabase `evidence` bucket created. A.P opens `infra/s2-quality-gates` covering S2-08, S2-09, S2-14. Feature rows S2-03..S2-07, S2-10, S2-11 fully unblocked for teammates to claim.
- _2026-04-29_: Settings / Me screen (P-12 / FR-10.2) shipped outside the sprint board. `/me` route is live. Key facts for teammates:
  - **`settingsProvider`** (`AsyncNotifierProvider<SettingsNotifier, SettingsState>`) at `features/settings/presentation/settings_providers.dart` — single source of truth for `themeMode` + `language` + notification prefs. Any feature that needs the current theme or language should `ref.watch(settingsProvider)`.
  - **`main.dart`** now watches `settingsProvider` and passes `themeMode` + `locale` to `MaterialApp.router`. Thai (`th`) is the default locale on a fresh install.
  - **Notification prefs are local-only** (SharedPreferences). API sync deferred to FR-8.x — do not assume they hit the backend yet.
  - **Notifier method is `.save(SettingsState)`**, not `.update()` — Riverpod's `AsyncNotifierBase` already owns `.update()`.
  - **New stub routes added:** `/my-reports`, `/privacy`, `/terms` (each shows "coming soon"). S2-07 owner (B.S): the biometric Settings toggle goes inside the existing `SettingsScreen` in a new `SECURITY` card section — coordinate with A.P before adding to avoid merge conflict.
  - **`flutter_localizations` + `intl`** added to `pubspec.yaml`. Run `flutter pub get` after pulling.
- _2026-04-29_: OQ-3 (province field) reinstated as **feed-filter-only** (PRD v1.3, D6 reversed). Province stored on `users` + `announcements` + `reports` (`province text NULL` Prisma migration, S3). Settings screen gets province picker + "Regional alerts" toggle (FR-10.3); alerts feed filters by province when toggle on (FR-8.6). **No FCM topics.** Owner recommendation: settings UI → B.S, alerts filter → Y.R, API + migration → T.P.
